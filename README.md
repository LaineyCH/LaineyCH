Just completed a Certificate in Web & Computer Programming, working towards a BSc degree in Software Development through BYUi Online.

Working on an imaginary Chamber of Commerce Website: [https://laineych.github.io/wdd231/chamber/index.html](https://laineych.github.io/wdd231/chamber/index.html)

âš¡ Fun fact: I already have a BSC degree in Ecology and COmputing, completed in 2010, and I am also an artist and designer.
